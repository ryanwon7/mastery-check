			<p> League of Legends is a popular multiplayer online battle arena(MOBA) video game, where a player assumes the role of a summoner. This summoner controls a certain champion which possessess a set of unique abilities, and battle against a team of other players. The game has two teams of five champions face off against each other, where the goal is to destroy the opposing team's Nexus, a structure in the center of each base. To achieve this goal, players can kill minions(neutral monsters) or enemy players to earn gold to buy items to power up their champions. </p>

Every game that a player uses a champion, they gain mastery points for that champion based on their game performance and outcome. Based on the mastery points, they are given a certain mastery status for that champion from Mastery 1 to Mastery 7, with the icons shown below reprsenting the masteries from 1 to 7.</p>
